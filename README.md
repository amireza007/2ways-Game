##TODO
### Improve "randomness" and "concentration" of gaps
### Make auto-generated Short and Long Obstacles
### Make randomly generated enemies (which the appearance based on the front face of obstacles) running toward the player
### Give the player a freedom of choice (Hardness VS. More Scores) by providing options to activate (almost) any challenge, at the price of achieving less score => New strategies would emerge?! :)
### Dynamic Game Difficulty Balancing for Increasing Retention
