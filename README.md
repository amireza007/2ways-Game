##TODO
### Improve "randomness" and "concentration" of gaps
### Make auto-generated Short and Long Obstacles
### Make randomly generated enemies (whose appearance could be based on the front face of the obstacles) running toward the player (and maybe trying to impale them to deflate the ball! :))
### Give the player a freedom of choice (Hardness VS. More Scores) by providing options to activate (almost) any challenge, at the price of achieving less score => New strategies would emerge?! :)
### Dynamic Game Difficulty Balancing for Increasing Retention
